A [GNU-FDL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) book on algorithmic graph theory by [David Joyner](http://www.wdjoyner.org), [Minh Van Nguyen](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/), and [David Phillips](http://www.usna.edu/Users/math/dphillip/). This is an introductory book on algorithmic graph theory. Theory and algorithms are illustrated using the [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org) open source mathematics software. To get an overview of the book, you can view the table of contents as shown below or download the complete book. This book is more commonly known as the "DaMNeD" book if you notice how our names are used to abbreviate the book. So feel free to call it the DaMNeD book :-)

Supplementary materials for the book can be found at https://bitbucket.org/mvngu/graphbook-supplement.

A companion book is [Explorations in Algebraic Graph Theory with Sage](http://buzzard.pugetsound.edu/sage-practice/).  This book covers how to use techniques from algebra to analyze many types of graphs.

The book is a work in progress; it is by no means complete yet. We as the authors work on it during our spare time. If you want to help out by contributing materials, that would be awesome and greatly appreciated.

**The latest revision of the book is called latest-rxxx.**
