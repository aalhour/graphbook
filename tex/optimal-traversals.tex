%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Eulerian graphs}

\begin{itemize}
\item multigraphs and simple graphs

\item Eulerian tours

\item Eulerian trails
\end{itemize}

\section{Hamiltonian graphs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Hamiltonian paths (or cycles)

\item Hamiltonian graphs
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}
\textbf{Ore 1960.}
Let $G$ be a simple graph with $n \geq 3$ vertices. If
$\deg(u) + \deg(v) \geq n$ for each pair of non-adjacent vertices
$u, v \in V(G)$, then $G$ is Hamiltonian.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
\textbf{Dirac 1952.}
Let $G$ be a simple graph with $n \geq 3$ vertices. If
$\deg(v) \geq n / 2$ for all $v \in V(G)$, then $G$ is Hamiltonian.
\end{corollary}
