\end{itemize}

A {\it binary search tree} (BST) is a rooted binary tree
$T=(V,E)$ having weighted vertices ${\rm wt}:V\to \R$ satisfying:
\index{binary search tree}
\index{BST}

\begin{itemize}
\item
 The left subtree of a vertex $v$ contains only vertices whose label
(or ``key'') is less than the label of $v$.
\item
The right subtree of a vertex $v$ contains only vertices whose label
  is greater than the label of $v$.
\item
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
\end{itemize}

From the above properties it naturally follows that:
{\it Each vertex has a distinct label.}


\subsubsection{Traversal}

The vertices of a BST $T$ can be visited retrieved in-order of the
weights of the vertices (i.e.,
using a symmetric search type) by recursively  traversing the left subtree of the
root vertex, then accessing the root vertex itself, then recursively traversing the
right subtree of the root node.

\subsubsection{Searching}

We are given a BST (i.e., a binary rooted tree with weighted vertices
having distinct weights satisfying the above criteria) $T$ and a
label $\ell$. For this search, we are looking for a vertex in $T$
whose label is $\ell$, if one exists.

We begin by examining the root vertex, $v_0$. If $\ell={\rm wt}(v_0)$,
the search is successful. If the $\ell<{\rm wt}(v_0)$,
search the left subtree. Similarly, if $\ell>{\rm wt}(v_0)$,
search the right subtree. This process is repeated until a vertex
$v\in V$ is found for which $\ell={\rm wt}(v)$,
or the indicated subtree is empty.


\subsubsection{Insertion}

We are given a BST (i.e., a binary rooted tree with weighted vertices
having distinct weights satisfying the above criteria) $T$ and a
label $\ell$. We assume $\ell$ is between the
lowest weight of $T$ and the highest weight.
For this procedure, we are looking for a ``parent''
vertex in $T$ which can ``adopt'' a new vertex $v$ having weight $\ell$
and for which this augmented tree $T\cup v$ satisfies
the criteria above.

Insertion proceeds as a search does. However, in this case, you are
searching for vertices $v_1,v_2\in V$ for which
${\rm wt}(v_1)<\ell < {\rm wt}(v_2)$. Once found, these
vertices will tell you where to insert $v$.

\subsubsection{Deletion}

As above, we are given a BST $T$ and a
label $\ell$. We assume $\ell$ is between the
lowest weight of $T$ and the highest weight.
For this procedure, we are looking for a vertex $v$ of
$T$ which has weight $\ell$. We want to remove $v$ from
$T$ (and therefore also the weight $\ell$ from the list of weights),
thereby creating a ``smaller'' tree $T- v$ satisfying
the criteria above.

Deletion proceeds as a search does. However, in this case, you are
searching for vertex $v\in V$ for which
${\rm wt}(v)=\ell$. Once found, we remove $v$ from $V$
and any edge $(u,v)\in E$ is replaced by $(u,w_1)$
and $(u,w_2)$, where $w_1.w_2\in V$ were the children of $v$
in $T$.

\subsubsection{Sorting}

A binary search tree can be used to implement a simple but efficient
sorting algorithm. Suppose we wish to sort a list of numbers
$L = [\ell_1, \ell_2,\dots, \ell_n]$. First, let $V=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$
be the vertices of a tree and weight vertex $i$ with $\ell_i$,
for $1\leq i\leq n$. In this case, we can traverse this tree
in order of its weights, thereby building a BST recursively.
This BST represents the sorting of the list $L$.
Generally, the information represented by each vertex is a
record (or list or dictionary), rather than a single data element. However,
for sequencing purposes, vertices are compared according to their
labels rather than any part of their associated records.

\subsubsection{Traversal}

The vertices of a BST $T$ can be visited retrieved in-order of the
weights of the vertices (i.e.,
using a symmetric search type) by recursively  traversing the left subtree of the
root vertex, then accessing the root vertex itself, then recursively traversing the
right subtree of the root node.

\subsubsection{Searching}

We are given a BST (i.e., a binary rooted tree with weighted vertices
having distinct weights satisfying the above criteria) $T$ and a
label $\ell$. For this search, we are looking for a vertex in $T$
whose label is $\ell$, if one exists.

We begin by examining the root vertex, $v_0$. If $\ell={\rm wt}(v_0)$,
the search is successful. If the $\ell<{\rm wt}(v_0)$,
search the left subtree. Similarly, if $\ell>{\rm wt}(v_0)$,
search the right subtree. This process is repeated until a vertex
$v\in V$ is found for which $\ell={\rm wt}(v)$,
or the indicated subtree is empty.

label $\ell$. We assume $\ell$ is between the
lowest weight of $T$ and the highest weight.

and for which this augmented tree $T\cup v$ satisfies
the criteria above.

searching for vertices $v_1,v_2\in V$ for which
${\rm wt}(v_1)<\ell < {\rm wt}(v_2)$. Once found, these
vertices will tell you where to insert $v$.

label $\ell$. We assume $\ell$ is between the
lowest weight of $T$ and the highest weight.

$T$ which has weight $\ell$. We want to remove $v$ from
$T$ (and therefore also the weight $\ell$ from the list of weights),
thereby creating a ``smaller'' tree $T- v$ satisfying

in $T$.

$L = [\ell_1, \ell_2,\dots, \ell_n]$. First, let $V=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$
be the vertices of a tree and weight vertex $i$ with $\ell_i$,
for $1\leq i\leq n$. In this case, we can traverse this tree
in order of its weights, thereby building a BST recursively.
This BST represents the sorting of the list $L$.
