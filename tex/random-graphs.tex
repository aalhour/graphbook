Random graphs are both highly predictable and easily built, and these are the reasons why they are so interesting. The most common way to generate them is given by Erdos-Renyi.

\section{Erd\H{o}s-R{\'e}nyi graphs}


\begin{definition}[Random Graph] A random graph $G_{n,p}$ can be build the following way : take a vertex set of cardinality $n$, and for each pair of vertices draw an edge between them with probability $p$.

Formally, $G_{n,p}$ is the random variable equal to $G$ with probability $p^{|E(G)|}(1-p)^{|E(\bar{G})|}$, for each graph $G$ on $n$ vertices.
\end{definition}

One of the first properties of random graphs which makes them so pleasent to work with is the following

\begin{theorem}
  Let $H$ be any graph, and $0<p<1$. Then
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow +\infty}P\left[H\text{ is an induced subgraph of }G_{n,p}\right]=1$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Sketch]
Instinctively, we would like to find a copy of $H$ in $G_{n,p}$ by iteratively finding an acceptable representant $h(v_i)$ in $G_{n,p}$ of every vertex $v_i$ of $V(H) = \{v_1, \dots, v_k\}$. How could such a strategy work ?
\begin{itemize}
\item Pick for $v_1$ any vertex $h(v_1)\in G_{n,p}$ 
\item Pick for $v_2$ any vertex $h(v_2)\in G_{n,p}$ such that $h(v_1)h(v_2)\in E(G_{n,p})$ if $v_1v_2\in E(H)$, and such that $h(v_1)h(v_2)\not \in E(G_{n,p})$ otherwise
\item \dots
\item Assuming you have found, for all $i\leq j\leq k$, a representant $h(v_i)$ for each vertex $v_i$, and such that $H[\{v_1,\dots,v_{j-1}\}]$ is isomorphic to $G_{n,p}[\{h(v_1),\dots,h(v_{j-1})\}]$, try to find a new vertex $h(v_j)$ such that $\forall i<j,h(v_i)h(v_j)\in E(G_{n,p})$ if  and only if $v_iv_j\in E(H)$.

  When $n$ is growing large, such a vertex will exist with high probability.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
  Formally, let us write $H_i = H[\{v_1,\dots,v_{j-1}\}]$, and denote the probability that $H$ is an induced subgraph of $G_{n,p}$ by $P[H\mapsto_{ind} G_{n,p}]$. We can roughly bound the probability that $H_i$, but not $H_{i+1}$, is an induced subgraph of $G_{n,p}$ the following way :

  \begin{itemize}
  \item We put a copy of $H_i$ at any of the $\binom n i$ different $i$-subsets of $V(G_{n,p})$. 

    This can be done, each time, in $i!$ different ways as the vertices $\{v_1, \dots, v_i\}$ can be permuted

  \item We compute the probability that no other vertex of $G_{n,p}$ can be used to complete our current copy of $H_i$ into a copy of $H_{i+1}$. The probability that such a vertex is acceptable being
    $$p^{d_{h_{i+1}}(v_{i+1})(1-p)^{i-d_{h_{i+1}}(v_{i+1})}}\geq min(p, 1-p)^i$$ 
    the property that none of the $n-i$ vertices left is acceptable is at most
    $$\left({ 1- min(p, 1-p)^i )} \right)^(n-i)$$
  \end{itemize}
  
  As $0<p<1$, we can write $0<\epsilon = min(p, 1-p)$ and thus, the probability that $H_i$, but not $H_{i+1}$, is a induced subgraph of $G_{n,p}$ is at most $$i!\binom n i (1-\epsilon^i)^{n-i}\leq i! n^i (1-\epsilon^i)^{n-i} = o(1/n)$$
Which is asymptotically equal to 0 as $n$ grows.

Thus

\begin{align*}
  P[H\mapsto_{ind} G_{n,p}]&=1 - P[H_2\mapsto_{ind} G_{n,p}, H_3\not \mapsto_{ind} G_{n,p}]\\
  &-P[H_3\mapsto_{ind} G_{n,p}, H_4\not \mapsto_{ind} G_{n,p}]\\
  &\dots\\
  &-P[H_{i-1}\mapsto_{ind} G_{n,p}, H_i\not \mapsto_{ind} G_{n,p}]\\
  P[H\mapsto_{ind} G_{n,p}]&\geq 1-\sum_{l\leq i}l!n^l(1-\epsilon^l)^{n-l}\\
  &\geq 1-k\times o(1/n)\\
\end{align*}

Which proves the result.

\end{proof}
