/* Based on igraph revision 2345, 2011-02-17. See https://launchpad.net/igraph
 * Simple undirected G(n,p) model. Fix n = 20,000 and consider r = 50
 * probability points chosen as follows. Let pmin = 0.000001, pmax = 0.999999,
 * F = (pmax / pmin)^(1 / (r-1)). For i = 1, 2, ..., r=50 the i-th
 * probability point p_i is defined by p_i = pmin * (F^(i-1)). Each experiment
 * consists in generating maxrun = 500 random graphs from G(n, p_i). For each
 * such graph Gi, compute the following quantities:
 *
 * * the actual number A of edges
 * * the expected number alpha of edges
 * * the actual total degree B
 * * the expected total degree beta
 *
 * Write the above metrics to a file named "i.dat", following the format:
 *
 * A  B
 *
 * The first line of the file contains the metrics
 *
 * alpha  beta
 *
 * That is, on the first line of the file we write the expected number of edges
 * and the expected total degree. On subsequent lines we write the
 * experimental values of A and B. The file "i.dat" should contain 501 lines
 * of data. The first line is the expected metrics as above and the remaining
 * 500 lines are for the experimental metrics A and B.
