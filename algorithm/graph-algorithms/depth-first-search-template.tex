%% input
\KwIn{A directed or undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ of order $n > 0$. A
  vertex $s$ from which to start the search. The vertices are numbered
  from $1$ to  $n = |V|$, i.e.~$V = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.}

%% output
\KwOut{A list $D$ of distances of all vertices from $s$. A tree $T$
  rooted at $s$.}
