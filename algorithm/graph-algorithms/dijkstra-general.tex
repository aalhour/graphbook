\Input{An undirected or directed graph $G = (V, E)$ that is weighted
  and has no self-loops. The order of $G$ is $n > 0$. A vertex $s \in V$
  from which to start the search. Vertices are numbered from 1 to $n$,
  i.e. $V = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.}
\Output{A list $D$ of distances such that $D[v]$ is the distance of a
  shortest path from $s$ to $v$. A list $P$ of vertex parents such
  that $P[v]$ is the parent of $v$, i.e. $v$ is adjacent from $P[v]$.}
