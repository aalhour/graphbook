%% input
\KwIn{An undirected or directed graph $G = (V, E)$ that is weighted
  and has no self-loops. Negative edge weights are allowed. The order
  of $G$ is $n > 0$. A vertex $s \in V$ from which to start the
  search. Vertices are numbered from 1 to $n$,
  i.e.~$V = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.}
%%
%% output
\KwOut{A list $D$ of distances such that $D[v]$ is the distance of a
  shortest path from $s$ to $v$. A list $P$ of vertex parents such
  that $P[v]$ is the parent of $v$, i.e. $v$ is adjacent from
  $P[v]$. If $G$ has negative-weight cycles, then return
  \MyFalse. Otherwise, return $D$ and $P$.}
