%% algorithm body
Initialize $f(u,v)=0$, for all edges $(u,v)\in E$\;

While there is a path $p$ from $s$ to $t$ in $G_f$, such that
$c_f(e) > 0$, for all edges $e\in E$:\;
\quad       Find $c_f(p) = min\{ c_f(u,v)\ |\ (u,v) \in p\}$,\;
\quad       For each edge $(u,v) \in $:\;
\quad   \quad        $f(u,v) = f(u,v) + c_f(p)$\;
\quad   \quad        $f(v,u) = f(v,u) - c_f(p)$\;
