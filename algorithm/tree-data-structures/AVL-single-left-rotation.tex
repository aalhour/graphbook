\KwIn{Three vertices $x,y,z$ of an augmented AVL tree $T_v$, where
  $z$ is the first height-unbalanced vertex in the path from $v$ up to
  the root of $T_v$. The left subtree of $z$ is denoted $T_0$ and the
  left subtree of $y$ is $T_1$. The left and right subtrees of $x$ are
  $T_2$ and $T_3$, respectively.}

%% output
\KwOut{A single left rotation to height-balance the subtree rooted at
  $z$.}
