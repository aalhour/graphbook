%% input
\KwIn{Two root lists $L_1$ and $L_2$, each containing the roots of
  binomial trees in the binomial heaps $H_1$ and $H_2$,
  respectively. Each root list $L_i$ is sorted in increasing order of
  vertex degree.}
%%
%% output
\KwOut{A single list $L$ that merges the root lists $L_i$ and sorted
  in nondecreasing order of degree.}
