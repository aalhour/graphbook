\Input{Three vertices $x,y,z$ of an augmented AVL tree $T_v$, where
  $z$ is the first height-unbalanced vertex in the path from $v$ up to
  the root of $T_v$. The roots of the left and right subtrees of $x$
  are denoted $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively.}
\Output{A right-left double rotation to height-balance the subtree
  rooted at $z$.}
