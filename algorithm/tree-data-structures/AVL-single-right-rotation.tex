\KwIn{Three vertices $x,y,z$ of an augmented AVL tree $T_v$, where
  $z$ is the first height-unbalanced vertex in the path from $v$ up to
  the root of $T_v$. The left subtree of $z$ is $T_3$ and the right
  subtree of $y$ is $T_2$. The left and right subtrees of $x$ are
  $T_0$ and $T_1$, respectively.}

\KwOut{A single right rotation to height-balance the subtree rooted at $z$.}
