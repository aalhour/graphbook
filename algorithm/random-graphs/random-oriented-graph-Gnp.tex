$G \assign$ random graph in $G(n,p)$ as per Algorithm~\ref{alg:random_graphs:linear_generate_random_sparse_Gnp}\;
$E \assign$ edge set of $G$\;
$G \assign$ directed version of $G$\;
$\MyCutOff \assign$ draw uniformly at random from $[0,1)$\;
\For{\rm each edge $uv \in E$}{
  $r \assign$ draw uniformly at random from $[0,1)$\;
  \eIf{$r < \MyCutOff$}{
    remove $uv$ from $G$\;
  }{
    remove $vu$ from $G$\;
  }
}
\Return $G$\;
