Algorithmic Graph Theory
http://code.google.com/p/graph-theory-algorithms-book/

A GNU-FDL [1] book on algorithmic graph theory by David Joyner [2],
Minh Van Nguyen [3], and Nathann Cohen [4]. This is an introductory
book on algorithmic graph theory. Theory and algorithms are
illustrated using the Sage [5] open source mathematics software. See
the file LICENSE for the licensing terms of the book.

The book is written using LaTeX [6] and TikZ/PGF [7]. It uses
Mercurial [8] as its version control system. To clone the latest
revision of the book, ensure you have Mercurial installed on your
system. Then issue any of the following commands from your command
line:

$ hg clone https://graph-theory-algorithms-book.googlecode.com/hg/ graph-theory
$ hg clone http://graph-theory-algorithms-book.googlecode.com/hg/ graph-theory

To compile a PDF version of the book, run the command

$ make

To delete junk files resulting from the compilation process, run

$ make clean

In fact, a successful compilation should automatically delete any junk
files resulting from the compilation process. The file util.sh is a script
that interfaces with utilities under the directory bin/.
