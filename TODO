TODO list
=========

This is a list of possible enhancements to the book.

* Balanced trees: 2-3-4 trees, red-black trees, B-trees

* Fibonaccian search, might require discussion of Fibonacci trees

* Prufer encoding and Cayley's formula
  Discuss these in the context of generating a random tree.
  Other algorithms for coding labelled trees can be found in the
  following:
