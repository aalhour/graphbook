% This file provides a high-level automatic export feature for tikz pictures.
% It allows to export EACH SINGLE FIGURE into a separate PDF.
%
% The simplest way is to use 
%
% \tikzexternalize{myarticle}
%
% it simply converts every figure using the write18 method. If that is not possible,
% you need to reconfigure \tikzexternalize: it can generate a list of figure file names 
% and you need to generate these figures manually (or with a script).
%
% It replaces \tikzpicture/ \endtikzpicture and \tikz and invokes \beginpgfgraphicnamed ... \endpgfgraphicnamed
% commands if necessary.

% source generic implementation:
\input pgfplotsoldpgfsupp_tikzexternalshared.code.tex
